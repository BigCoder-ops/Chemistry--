    "content": "This week, we focused on literature review and project planning. We identified key areas for research: lithium-ion vs lead-acid batteries comparison. Initial research indicates lithium-ion batteries have higher energy density but lead-acid is more cost-effective for certain applications.\n\nTasks completed:\n1. Project timeline established\n2. Literature review started\n3. Safety procedures documented\n\nNext week: Begin experimental setup and initial testing.",
